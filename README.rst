ChatGPT API with Python and Packet Tracer
=========================================

Abstract
--------

You are using your trusted Generative AI on a daily basis, right? But how about looking under the hood? What exactly happens when your chatbot client sends your prompt to the model? Actually, there is an API in action there. And the same API is directly available for you, and you can use it in your application. 

In this session, we learn about OpenAI's ChatGPT programmable interface and how to build Python code to use it. Also, we will look into connecting ChatGPT with another API-enabled service - Packet Tracer.
